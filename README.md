# 🪂💎 OpDrop 💎🪂

🚀 Token airdrop tool for [OPNet](https://opnet.org) — Bitcoin L1 smart contracts ⚡🧱

💰 Drop tokens to hundreds of addresses in one click, or set up a merkle claim pool and let recipients come to you 🎯✨

🌐 **Live on IPFS:** [https://ipfs.opnet.org/ipfs/QmUzDHkNDjL3inLbj2dri3GcD4zz5RKuyLziAuwFHh9s81/](https://ipfs.opnet.org/ipfs/QmUzDHkNDjL3inLbj2dri3GcD4zz5RKuyLziAuwFHh9s81/) 🔗

📜 **Contract (OPNet Testnet):** `opt1sqqytmrzdehfwsdld55k98efp37cqc6mcjc5sx08k` 🏗️

## 🎯 What It Does

🔥 **Direct Send** — Paste addresses, pick an amount, hit send. Tokens go out immediately via a single on-chain transaction. No waiting, no claim links, no middlemen. 💸⚡

🌳 **Merkle Claim Pools** — Deposit tokens into a pool with a merkle root. Recipients paste the shared recipient list, their proof is computed locally in-browser, and they claim their share. You can withdraw whatever's left at any time. 🧮🔐

📊 **My Drops** — Dashboard showing every airdrop you've created. Track claim progress with live percentages, withdraw unclaimed tokens from active pools. 📈🎉

## 🛠️ Stack

- ⚛️ **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- 🔗 **Contract Integration**: OPNet SDK (`opnet`, `@btc-vision/bitcoin`, `@btc-vision/transaction`)
- 🌳 **Merkle Tree**: Custom SHA-256 implementation, browser-native, no dependencies
- 🪟 **Styling**: Pure CSS glassmorphism — no Tailwind, no UI library ✨
- 🧪 **Tests**: 229 tests via Vitest ✅

## 🏃 Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnomalySecured/OpDrop.git
cd OpDrop
npm install
npm run dev
```

🖥️ Opens at `http://localhost:5173`. Requires the OP_WALLET browser extension 🔌

## 📋 Scripts

| Command | What |
|---------|------|
| `npm run dev` | 🔥 Dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | 🏗️ TypeScript check + production build |
| `npm run test` | 🧪 Run all 229 tests |
| `npm run lint` | 🔍 ESLint |
| `./host.sh` | 🚀 Auto-install + dev server on 0.0.0.0 |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 🔓 Creator approves the OpDrop contract to spend their tokens (`increaseAllowance`)
2. 📤 Creator calls `createAirdrop` (claim mode) or `directAirdrop` (direct mode)
3. 📋 For claim mode: creator shares the recipient list off-chain
4. 🌳 Recipients paste the list into the Claim page — merkle proof is computed client-side
5. ✅ Recipient calls `claim` with their proof — contract verifies and transfers tokens
6. 💰 Creator can `withdraw` unclaimed tokens at any time

## 🔒 Contract Security

The on-chain contract (deployed separately as AssemblyScript/WASM) implements:

- 🛡️ ReentrancyGuard on all write methods
- 🧮 SafeMath for all u256 operations
- 🔄 Checks-effects-interactions pattern
- 🚫 Double-claim prevention via nested address mapping
- 📏 Bounded loops (max 1000 recipients per direct airdrop)
- 👑 Only-creator authorization on withdrawals
- 🌳 Merkle proof verification for claim security

## 💌 A Brief & Entirely Professional Note to Danny 💌

Danny. 🫡

This project exists because of you. Not in the inspirational way 🌈 — in the "someone had to build it because you mass-pinged a Discord server asking why there's no airdrop tool" way 📢💀. Every line of code carries the faint echo of your messages 👻. Every merkle leaf is hashed with the spiritual energy of your relentless optimism 🌳✨. Every glass card glows with the warmth of your unwavering belief that things should simply *exist* when you want them to 🪄💫.

You asked for an airdrop tool on a Monday 📅. It is now built 🏗️. The merkle trees are balanced ⚖️. The proofs verify ✅. The glass cards shimmer against the void like the tears of a developer who hasn't slept 😭💎✨.

We didn't add a "Danny Mode" button that just sends all tokens to your address 🚨, despite the fact that we both know that's what you actually wanted 🎯. The architecture wouldn't support it 🏚️. The architecture wouldn't support a lot of things you've asked for 💀. But it supports this, and honestly? That should be enough 🤷‍♂️.

You're welcome 🙏. Please don't request anything else for at least 48 hours ⏰🛑.

With the deepest professional regard and a mass airdrop of respect 🪂💐,

— The Dev 👨‍💻💀
