# OpDrop

Token airdrop tool for [OPNet](https://opnet.org) — Bitcoin L1 smart contracts.

Drop tokens to hundreds of addresses in one click, or set up a merkle claim pool and let recipients come to you.

**Live on IPFS:** [https://bafybeifaxxx3wdorgc5a2m4nztaxitkndsif564nv5pvmyggdvpemj6s7y.ipfs.dweb.link/](https://bafybeifaxxx3wdorgc5a2m4nztaxitkndsif564nv5pvmyggdvpemj6s7y.ipfs.dweb.link/)

**Contract (OPNet Testnet):** `opt1sqqytmrzdehfwsdld55k98efp37cqc6mcjc5sx08k`

## What It Does

**Direct Send** — Paste addresses, pick an amount, hit send. Tokens go out immediately via a single on-chain transaction. No waiting, no claim links, no middlemen.

**Merkle Claim Pools** — Deposit tokens into a pool with a merkle root. Recipients paste the shared recipient list, their proof is computed locally in-browser, and they claim their share. You can withdraw whatever's left at any time.

**My Drops** — Dashboard showing every airdrop you've created. Track claim progress with live percentages, withdraw unclaimed tokens from active pools.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Contract Integration**: OPNet SDK (`opnet`, `@btc-vision/bitcoin`, `@btc-vision/transaction`)
- **Merkle Tree**: Custom SHA-256 implementation, browser-native, no dependencies
- **Styling**: Pure CSS glassmorphism — no Tailwind, no UI library
- **Tests**: 229 tests via Vitest

## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnomalySecured/OpDrop.git
cd OpDrop
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`. Requires the OP_WALLET browser extension.

## Scripts

| Command | What |
|---------|------|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | TypeScript check + production build |
| `npm run test` | Run all 229 tests |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `./host.sh` | Auto-install + dev server on 0.0.0.0 |

## Architecture

```
src/
  abi/            Contract ABI definition
  components/     Reusable UI (Alert, Modal, ProgressBar, Spinner, etc.)
  config/         Network configs, contract addresses
  contracts/      Contract source reference documentation
  hooks/          useDropOp (contract calls), useWallet, useNetwork
  pages/          SendPage, ClaimPage, MyDropsPage
  services/       Singleton provider + contract instance cache
  types/          TypeScript interfaces for contract + app state
  utils/          Merkle tree, CSV parsing, formatting
  test/           12 test suites, 229 tests
```

## How It Works

1. Creator approves the OpDrop contract to spend their tokens (`increaseAllowance`)
2. Creator calls `createAirdrop` (claim mode) or `directAirdrop` (direct mode)
3. For claim mode: creator shares the recipient list off-chain
4. Recipients paste the list into the Claim page — merkle proof is computed client-side
5. Recipient calls `claim` with their proof — contract verifies and transfers tokens
6. Creator can `withdraw` unclaimed tokens at any time

## Contract Security

The on-chain contract (deployed separately as AssemblyScript/WASM) implements:

- ReentrancyGuard on all write methods
- SafeMath for all u256 operations
- Checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Double-claim prevention via nested address mapping
- Bounded loops (max 1000 recipients per direct airdrop)
- Only-creator authorization on withdrawals
- Merkle proof verification for claim security

## A Brief & Entirely Professional Note to Danny

Danny.

This project exists because of you. Not in the inspirational way — in the "someone had to build it because you mass-pinged a Discord server asking why there's no airdrop tool" way. Every line of code carries the faint echo of your messages. Every merkle leaf is hashed with the spiritual energy of your relentless optimism. Every glass card glows with the warmth of your unwavering belief that things should simply *exist* when you want them to.

You asked for an airdrop tool on a Monday. It is now built. The merkle trees are balanced. The proofs verify. The glass cards shimmer against the void like the tears of a developer who hasn't slept.

We didn't add a "Danny Mode" button that just sends all tokens to your address, despite the fact that we both know that's what you actually wanted. The architecture wouldn't support it. The architecture wouldn't support a lot of things you've asked for. But it supports this, and honestly? That should be enough.

You're welcome. Please don't request anything else for at least 48 hours.

With the deepest professional regard and a mass airdrop of respect,

— The Dev
